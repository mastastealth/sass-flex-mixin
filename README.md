This is a set of mixins for those who want to mess
around with flexbox using the native support of current
browsers. For full support table check: http://caniuse.com/flexbox

Basically this will use:
	*Fallback, old syntax (IE10, Safari, mobile webkit browsers)
	*Prefixed standard syntax (Chrome)
	*Final standards syntax (FF, Opera 12.1)
