	This is a set of mixins for those who want to mess
	around with flexbox using the native support of current
	browsers. For full support table check: http://caniuse.com/flexbox

	Basically this will use:
		Fallback, old syntax (IE10, Safari, mobile webkit browsers)
		Prefixed standard syntax (Chrome)
		Final standards syntax (FF, Opera 12.1)
